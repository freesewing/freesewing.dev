## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. It's a modular system (check our list
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/reference/plugins) and getting started is as simple as:

```bash
npx create-freesewing-pattern
```

The [getting started](https://freesewing.dev/guides/getting-started/) section on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) is a good
entrypoint to our documentation, but you'll find a lot more there, including [references to our API's](https://freesewing.dev/reference/),
as well as [our tutorials](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/),
and [best practices](https://freesewing.dev/guides/best-practices/).

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.
